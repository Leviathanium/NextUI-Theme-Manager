## Guide
In the menu, there are several options:

_Theme Management_
1. **Themes (still work in progress):** These are going to be curated themes created by the community that will change individual system backgrounds, LEDs, accent colors, icons, AND fonts all at once. Right now it's only partially working.
2. **Customization:** Here, you can change specific wallpaper/icon/font elements for your device. You can also choose from a series of preset LED/accent options, or import/export your own in `Theme-Manager.pak/Accents` or `Theme-Manager.pak/LEDs`.
3. **Reset:** This offers the ability to either _remove or replace with black_ ALL `bg.png` files across NextUI if you want to start over fresh.

_Customization_
1. **Global Options:** Apply global icons/wallpapers to the entire device from `Theme-Manager.pak/Themes/Global` and `Theme-Manager.pak/Icons`. There are a few presets to mess around with, or if you create your own, you can apply them from here.
2. **System Options:** Apply system-specific icons/wallpapers if you want to get really technical. This also includes `Recently Played`, `Tools`, and `Collections` as well!
3. **Accents:** Choose from several preset options, or export your custom-built options! They are exported as `.txt` files in `Theme-Manager.pak/Accents/Custom`.
4. **LEDs:** Choose from several preset options, or export your custom-built options! They are exported as `.txt` files in `Theme-Manager.pak/LEDs/Custom`.
5. **Fonts:** (Currently borked since NextUI 3.0 release, will fix soon!) For now we're just testing with a couple demo examples, but fonts are in `Theme-Manager.pak/Fonts`.
