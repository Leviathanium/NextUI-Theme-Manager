# NextUI Themes

This repository contains a collection of themes for NextUI, designed for the TrimUI Brick. These themes are a work in progress, and many are suggestions or contributions from the official NextUI Discord server. 

These themes come with no icons of any kind, so you will have to manually scrape your boxart yourself using Skraper or Artwork Manager.pak. These are just a collection of curated wallpapers for now.

It is also important to note that currently, for dynamic themes, NOT ALL SYSTEMS HAVE ARTWORK YET. Only curated artwork is available for certain systems.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Move the `Theme-Manager.pak` folder into your `Tools/tg5040` directory on your SD card.
3. Launch it on your Brick and change your theme! Currently this app only supports *global themes* so whichever you select will apply to the entire device.
